# OP-Code-1

A small tribute to the Underscore.js library ...as a purely academic exercise.

## Setup

1. Create a fork of this repository.

2. Clone the fork to your local machine with
`git clone https://github.com/<USER_NAME>/OP-Code-1.git`

## Usage

TBD

## Reccomendations

1. COMMIT OFTEN!

  * One way to make this easier is to think about what your commit message will be BEFORE writing any code.

  * As a general rule, try to make a commit for every method, but feel free to make more commits if you reach good a good stopping point.

2. Write tests BEFORE writing the code being tested.
  
  * Ideally, put the test on its own commit. But feel free to add more tests after writing a method if you realize there is an uncovered case.

  * You should always see your tests fail at least once. Doing so will help verify that your tests are providing value.
